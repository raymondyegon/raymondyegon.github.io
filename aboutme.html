      <p>I am Raymond but i prefer to go by "Code Beast". I graduate from high school in 2017.</p>
      <p>With a passion in Cyber security i joined Moringa School to build up my programming skills and to have a good foundation in my career. It turns out Moringa is not just a normal school but a unique one, it tends to focus more on your development rather than coding alone.</p>
      <p>I love doing lots of stuffs but the main ones i have listed them <a href="favourites.html" id="link">HERE</a></p>
