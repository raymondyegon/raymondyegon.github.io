        <div class="desc">
          <p>I love watching movies since it increases my creativity level and thinking capacity. I enjoy sci-fi, action, thrillers, at times horror, and comedy. When it comes to series i enjoy investigative and crime based ones. They always get my brain working when watching them.</p><br>

        <div class="desc">
          <p>Music is widely known to be an important part of people's way of life and just like everyone i have aliving. I listen to all genres but as long as the song impresses me and with good beats then am good to go. Though at times i prefer hiphop, locals and reggea, it all depends with the current mood swing.</p><br>

          <div class="desc">
            <p>This is one of the most interesting things i like in my life. I have loved cars since my childhood days and everyone who has ever stayed with me knows it. I love speedy cars and classic cars. I know how the basic engineering and tech behind the scene of drivings and would explore more with time. I plan on developing technology for cars later on.</p>
