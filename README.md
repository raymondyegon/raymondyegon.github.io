## Description
{This is a website, a portfolio page that describes Raymond Yegon, the author. I build it as a partial fulfilment of my graduation from Moringa School. It shows the basic html and css skills i have learned within five days. It includes links, background images, responsive webpages among others}
## Setup/Installation Requirements
{This is website that fully operates on its own and requires no other codes to run. You just click the link and land land on the website.}
## Known Bugs
{I recommend you use a device with high resolution because of the picture pixels. }
## Technologies Used
{I only used HTML and CSS to make the website running. I made the website pretty responsive with only CSS queries.}
## Support and contact details
{Incase you have any suggestions or compliments just fork the code or send me a pull request.}
